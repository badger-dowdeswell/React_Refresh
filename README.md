# React Refresh

This project is a referesher course that explores Next.js and React 19 using the Udemy course "Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

With the release of Next.js 15, and with the update to React 19, there are a lot of changes in the way both Next and React can be used in front-end projects. This repository tracks a range of applications developed during the course.

The React organisation (www.react.dev) has deprecated the create-react-app fuctionality and reccomends using Next.js as their preferred framework for using the React library.
